## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a deep learning model for **food image classification** using transfer learning with **EfficientNetV2L**. It is developed as part of the **Submission 2** requirement for the Dicoding course: *Belajar Pengembangan Machine Learning*.

The model is trained on the **Food11 Image Dataset**, which contains 16,643 images across 11 categories of common food items. This project covers the complete pipeline: data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and model conversion for deployment on web and mobile platforms.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a robust and efficient image classification model that can accurately classify food images into predefined categories. It also aims to demonstrate skills in using pretrained models, fine-tuning, model evaluation, and exporting for cross-platform deployment.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using **EfficientNetV2L** as the base feature extractor with the top classification layers removed (`include_top=False`). Only the last 30 layers are set to be trainable to allow fine-tuning on the food dataset.

Custom layers added after the base model include:
- `Conv2D` layers with ReLU activation and `BatchNormalization`
- `MaxPooling2D` and `GlobalAveragePooling2D`
- `Dropout` for regularization
- Fully connected `Dense` layers
- `Softmax` output layer matching the number of classes

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Food11 Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trolukovich/food11-image-dataset)
- **Total images**: 16,643
- **Classes**:
  - Bread, Dairy product, Dessert, Egg, Fried food, Meat, Noodles-Pasta, Rice, Seafood, Soup, Vegetable-Fruit
- **Splits**:
  - `training/`
  - `validation/`
  - `evaluation/`

## Preprocessing Steps

- Resize images to 384x384 pixels
- Normalize pixel values using `preprocess_input` from EfficientNet
- Load datasets using TensorFlow's `image_dataset_from_directory`

## How to Run

1. Open `notebook-clasifikasi-makanan.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset or mount it from Kaggle
3. Run each cell sequentially
4. The model will be saved and ready for inference or deployment
